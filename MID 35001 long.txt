MID 35001, US v Peru, 16 Dec 1968 to 15-Jan-69 to 17-May-69

98 - The President's News Conference
March 4, 1969

THE PRESIDENT. What Peru has done, as you know, in the seizure of our oil company is that under international law they have theright to expropriate a company but they also have the obligation to pay a fair amount for that expropriation. 
It is the second point that is at issue, not theright to expropriate. Now if they do not take appropriate steps to provide for that payment, then under the law-the Hickenlooper amendment, 1 as you know--we will have to take appropriate action with regard to the sugar quota and also with regard to aid programs. 
I hope that it is not necessary because that would have a domino effect--if I can be permitted to use what is supposed to be an outworn term--a domino effect all over Latin America. 
I feel, in my studies in recent days, that we are making some progress in attempting to get some steps taken by the Peruvian Government to deal with the expropriation matter in a fair way.2 If they do so then we do not have to go down that road.

Let me also say that there is no question of what they claim as their air space. Some of you, of course, know the confusion and, as a matter of fact, the confrontation we are having with Peru about the 200-mile limit.3 North Korea claims only 12 miles as its limit, so we were at least 28 miles away at the very closest point
