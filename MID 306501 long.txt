Remarks at the Annual Convention of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith 
June 10, 1983

June 30, 1983

Forty percent of all of our foreign trade and two-thirds of our petroleum imports pass through the Panama Canal and the sea-lanes of the Caribbean, where we see construction in Cuba of a naval base from which Soviet nuclear submarines can now operate, a Soviet capacity for air reconnaissance over our eastern coast from Cuban bases, the building of an enormous war machine in Nicaragua aided by thousands of Cuban military personnel, sophisticated weapons, including Soviet-made tanks and arms from Cuba, the Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc, Libya, and the PLO to name a few.



Remarks of President Reagan and President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire Following Their Meeting 
August 4, 1983

I expressed our admiration for President Mobutu's courageous action in sending troops to assist the Government of Chad in its struggle against Libyan-backed rebels. On the home front, the President has informed me of progress on his government's economic stabilization plan. Zaire is taking the difficult but necessarysteps to ensure sustained economic progress, and it's important that we and Zaire's other friends do what we can to help.
