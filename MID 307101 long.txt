MID 307101, US v Iran, 28 dec 1982 to 27-Jan-83 to 26-Jul-83

Remarks at the Annual Washington Conference of the American Legion 
February 22, 1983

The Soviets sent their Cuban mercenaries to Angola and Ethiopia, used chemical weapons against innocent Laotians and Cambodians, and invaded Afghanistan—all with impunity. Perhaps the most degrading symbol of this dismal situation was the spectacle of Iranian terrorists seizing American hostages and humiliating them and our country for more than a year


Remarks at the Welcoming Ceremony for Amir Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa of Bahrain 
July 19, 1983

Your Highness, I want to assure you that I share your concern about the conflict between Iraq and Iran. The loss of tens of thousands of young men on both sides and the destruction borne by both countries is tragic. I look forward to consulting with you about what more our countries might do to encourage a negotiated end to this conflict, which threatens the security and even the marine ecology of the entire area
